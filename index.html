            <h2>research</h2>
            <p>Currently working on my MD thesis about Autism Spectrum Disorder-related connectome alterations.<br>
              I investigate the relation between geodesic distance and resting state functional connectivity in ASD during a research internship at the Montreal Neurological Institute/McGill Univeristy,
              Canada. <br>
              During my time as research scholar at the Yale School of Medicine, Department of Neuroradiology, I studied alterations in microstructure based on diffusion
              weighted MR images.
              This study was presented at the Annual Meeting of the American Society of Functional Neuroradiology (Sep. 21, Santa Fe, NM) and
              at the Annual Meeting of the Radiological Society of North America (Nov. 21, Chicago, IL), upcoming poster presentation at the Annual Meetin of the American
              Society for Pediatric Neuroradiology (ASPNR, Jan. 22, Miami, FL).<br>
              I am part of the Luebeck-based Social Neuroscience Lab.

            <h2>previously...</h2>
            <p>I study medicine (4th year in a six year program) and computer science (1st year) at Luebeck University in Germany, where I am
              part of the Social Neuroscience Lab to get my german doctorate degree in Medicine. <br>
              During the pandemic, I taught myself a whole lot of stuff, e.g. coding, machine learning, and, after i came to Yale, web development. <br>
              I first went to university at the age of fifteen at Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich, where I visited courses from all faculties to get
              a general overview of what I wanted to do. Back then, I also became part of Fraunhofer Society (one of the four largest research societies in Germany)
              youth network and attended workshops and meetings. <br>
              I also participated in programs all over the place, including the Plato Youth Forum in Salzburg, Sustainability Academy in Papenburg, Youth Congresses etc. and volunteered
              for the Federal Agency for Civic Education as Peer Educator and jury member for the german Youth Democracy Award. Additionally, I was board member
              of my school's development council, voluntarily tutored disadvantaged children, worked as climbing trainer, was elected member of my university's student council,
              and participated twice in the Berlin Half Marathon as a fundraising event for Doctors Without Borders. <br>
              I am active member of Universities Allied for Essential Medicines and organized talks about Neglected Tropical Diseases, Patents in Medicines, and the Ebola crisis. <br>
              Besides doing all of this academic/voluntary stuff, I like long distance running (competed in 8 marathons, including 2 world majors).
             </p>
             <h2>what's next</h2>
             <p>I want to transfer to a MD/PhD program, get my degrees while hopefully continuing to learn all kind of stuff on the side, and then work in health tech.</p>
